# Beyond 3DMM Space: Towards Fine-grained 3D Face Reconstruction

## Introduction
This repo releases the code and data in the paper: Beyond 3DMM Space: Towards Fine-grained 3D Face Reconstruction](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/papers/2020beyond.pdf). 


## Fine-grained 3D Face (FG3D) Data
FG3D contains 213,367 samples with rich variations in shapes and poses. It is constructed by 11,767 face scans from FRGC, BP4D and CASIA-3D and out-of-plane pose augmentation. Each sample contrains an image and its corrsponding registered 3D face.
