# Beyond 3DMM Space: Towards Fine-grained 3D Face Reconstruction

## Introduction
This repo releases the code and data in the paper: Beyond 3DMM Space: Towards Fine-grained 3D Face Reconstruction](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/papers/2020beyond.pdf). 


## Fine-grained 3D Face (FG3D) Data
FG3D are constructed from FRGC, BP4D and CASIA-3D. We register and out-of-plane augment the three datasets, generating a large 3D dataset with 213,367 samples. Among FG3D, 90% subjects are used as the training set and the rest 10\% subjects are the testing set.
